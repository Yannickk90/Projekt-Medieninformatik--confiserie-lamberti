# Confiserie Lamberti Website - Dark Chocolate Theme

This is the dark chocolate themed version of the Confiserie Lamberti website. The design uses rich, dark chocolate images as seamless parallax backgrounds, creating an elegant and luxurious feel.

## Background Images

The website requires 4 high-quality chocolate images to be placed in the `images/backgrounds/` directory:

1. `chocolate-praline.jpg` - The main hero background showing a chocolate praline with red toppings
2. `chocolate-liquid.jpg` - A swirling liquid chocolate background
3. `chocolate-production.jpg` - Chocolate production with rows of pralines
4. `chocolate-truffle.jpg` - Close-up of chocolate truffle on a dark surface

These images should be high resolution and will be used as full-page parallax backgrounds between the main content sections.
